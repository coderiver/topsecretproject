16.	MERCHANT SERVICES
16.1	To create an invoice, you may post a request to Cubits to collect a specific amount in your local currency, such as sterling or euros, or in bitcoin. Cubits will pull the exchange rate and provide the bitcoin payment instructions to the purchaser. We guarantee the exchange rate to you as long as the purchaser pays within the proper time window after the invoice is created. While we guarantee the exchange rate as long as the purchaser pays within such time window, you agree that you assume the volatility risk of your local currency or bitcoin, as applicable. For instance, if you ask us to collect £150, and the purchaser sends the payment within the time window, we guarantee you will receive exactly £150, minus our fee, but do not guarantee the value of sterling. 
16.2	When you customer pays your invoice for for your goods/services, we will receive the bitcoins and exchange them into fiat. After we have withdrawn our fees from the transaction amount, we will remit the fiat currency to the bank account that you have designated on your application form. We bear no responsibility for the funds not reaching you due to you not providing us with correct bank account details. The settlement of fiat to your bank account should be done as soon as reasonably possible, we estimate 24-48 hours settlement although we do not guarantee a time frame due to this being dependent on the speed of the banks involved and their respective locations.
17.	EXCHANGE SERVICES
17.1	Where you trade bitcoin with us we will present to you a price for bitcoin. If you proceed with the purchase of bitcoin then the transaction is irreversible. You are able to pay for the bitcoins using a number of methods, of which involves the use of third party payment service providers. We bear no responsibility for any malfunction, delay or other issues relating to those third parties and the adequacy of their services. Once we receive confirmation of payment to us then you will immediately have access to your bitcoins in your wallet. You agree not to reverse any transaction for the purchase of bitcoins, such as by recalling a transfer or initiating a chargeback. Instances of reversals by you will be treated seriously and we reserve the right to close your account, seize any bitcoins left to mitigate our losses and, where necessary, take legal action against you to recover any losses we incur as a result of your reversal of a transaction.
17.2	You agree that the price of bitcoin is volatile and that we do not provide a guarantee on the value of bitcoins. You appreciate that bitcoin is a high risk digital asset when deciding to purchase or deal in bitcoins and use our services. We bear no responsibility for any losses you may incur as a result of the price volatility of bitcoin. 
18.	FEES
18.1	We charge a processing fee on all transactions. The proceeds payable to you will equal the amount of the invoice (assuming that we have received the full amount of the invoice from the purchaser), unless you agree to accept less than the amount of the invoice, minus the processing fee. We reserve the right to change our fees and will give you 30 calendar days’ prior notice of any fee increase. Your continued use of the Services after we notify you of any increase in our fees constitutes your acceptance of such change. Current pricing information is provided on the Website.
18.2	Where we offer a discount or promotion (Promotions) in respect of our fees, we are not bound to maintain such Promotions and we may withdraw the same at any time at our discretion.
18.3	You will pay our fees on such basis and with such frequency as we request.
19.	METHODS OF SETTLEMENT
19.1	We will clear the payments over the bitcoin peer-to-peer payment network and post the balance to your accounting ledger, according to your preference settings. The debits and credits to your accounting ledger are funds temporarily held by Cubits until settlement to your bank account can take place. You can receive a settlement in your local currency, in bitcoins, or in a mixture of both. You assume volatility risks of the currency in which you choose to be settled. If you choose to keep bitcoins, then you assume the volatility risk of the bitcoin value.
20.	REFUND PROCEDURES
20.1	In the event that you wish to issue a refund to a purchaser, Cubits can handle this. You can decide to issue a partial refund or the full amount of the initial purchase. You can also decide whether to issue the original amount of the invoice in your local currency or in the number of bitcoins paid. If you do not have enough funds in your Cubits account to cover the refund, Cubits may require you to deposit bitcoins into your Cubits account to cover the refund to the purchaser. Any required currency conversion during the refund process will be calculated at a spot rate available at the time. Under no circumstances do we guarantee a refund of bitcoin at the same price at which the bitcoins were originally exchanged for with the Merchant.  
21.	DISCLOSURE OF REFUND POLICY
21.1	Under the Merchant Service, Merchants are required to have a clear refund policy, and to disclose that policy to their customers. We recommend you refund the amount of the initial purchase in the currency in which the item was priced.
22.	PURCHASER COMPLAINTS
22.1	Purchasers filing complaints about a purchase will be forwarded to you for resolution. Cubits reserves the right to terminate accounts which receive excessive complaints.
23.	ACCOUNT TERMINATION
23.1	You may close your Cubits account at any time. You will still be obligated to us for any fees incurred before the closure and we will remit to you funds not yet paid to you and associated with pre-closure sales. If your account balance is below our documented minimum transfer amount, you may be responsible for any transactions fees that may be incurred in the funds transfer.
23.2	We may terminate these Terms and close your account, at our discretion, at any time, upon notice to you via email or phone communication. We may also suspend your access to the Services if we suspect that you have failed to comply with these Terms, pose an unacceptable fraud risk to us, or if you provide any false, incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information. We will not be liable to you for any losses that you incur in connection with our closure or suspension of your account.
23.3	If your Cubits account is closed, you agree: (a) to continue to be bound by these Terms, (b) to immediately stop using the Services, (c) that the licence provided under these Terms shall end, (d) that we reserve the right (but have no obligation) to delete all of your information and account data stored on our servers, and (e) that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for termination of access to the Services or for deletion of your information or account data.
24.	INDEMNIFICATION
